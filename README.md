# Hexapod Arduino Control
Arduino Control code for a DIY laser cut hexapod.

This is a work in progress, with help from [Jonathan](http://hackerspace-adelaide.org.au/blog/author/jonw/) & [Pix](mailto:thapixguy@gmail.com).

## Hardware
* Arduino Duemilanove - http://arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardDuemilanove
* 2 x Sparkfun TLC 5940 breakout boards - https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10616
* TLC 5940 Arduino Library - http://code.google.com/p/tlc5940arduino/
* 18 TowerPro SG90 9G micro servos - https://www.adafruit.com/products/169

## Build
The design is based on the SpiderBot hexapod by mind, with some minor changes to fit my servos:

I'm building my hexapod at Hackerspace Adelaide, so if you'd like to help out or have a nosey, please come along for a visit:

The laser cut parts were cut at Adelaide FabLab:

There's a great blog describing how to wire up the 5940 breakout boards to your Arduino:
